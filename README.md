# Virtual_Mouse
This is a real-time Python Project.
Adding some Screenshots where I have shown some browsing i.e. codeforces, bdjobs, etc, and showing some properties like the distance between landmarks 4 and 8, mouse movement by landmark 4, and mouse clicking by the below distance between landmarks 4 and 8.
